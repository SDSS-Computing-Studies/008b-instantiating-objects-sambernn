"""
Create a class that will store a database for a veterinarian.
Your class will need the following properties:

animal (dog, cat, fish, bird, turtle, etc)
breed
name (the pet's name)
owner (the owner's name)
birthdate (of the pet, expressed as yyyy-mm-dd)

The constructor will need to ask for each of those values
for the database when the pet is instantiated

Methods:
display() - should show the name of the pet and type followed by their breed and owner


Main block should have a menu that has the following options:
1. Enter a new pet
2. Retrieve a pet
3. Exit

If they choose to retrieve a pet,
display the following:
Enter pet's name:
and then go through the list, looking for the name of the pet.
If the pet is found, it should call the display() method from the object

Example output:
1. Enter a new pet
2. Retrieve a pet
3. Exit
